Carrey was born in Canada on January 17, 1962 and was raised in poverty with a fincally unstable family, he had to work two jobs for 8 hours a day to help his family. He first gained recongition in 1990 for his star role in the show Living Color. 
Some of his popular movies were Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, followed up with Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. At only 15 years old, he preformed comedy at a Toronto comedy club and gained lots of attention for himself.

I chose Jim Carrey as my hero or the person that I look up to because he started off with almost nothing, but he never gave up and worked hard until he got to a point where he was on top and helped his family finacially. I admire that dedication going from nothing to one of the most popular actors of all time.
His journey has inspired me to persevere more and work hard to achieve things; Carrey's movies are also really funny and reminds me of my comedy. I have watched his movies a lot with my dad and I, his way of acting is why he is my favorite actor and why he has impacted me.
